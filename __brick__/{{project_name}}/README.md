An opinionated Flutter project for starting with AWS Amplify.

The project uses:
- [Amplify Authenticator](https://pub.dev/packages/amplify_authenticator), for authentication
- [Amplify Datastore](https://pub.dev/packages/amplify_datastore) for saving data and real time updates
- [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) for state management.
- 
## Getting Started

The project is structured and configured for your usage. Only thing you have to do is to change your changes to the cloud __IF__ you have not done it yet. 

```shell
amplify push
```

With this command, you are pushing your changes to the cloud. These changes will take a couple of minutes so in the meantime enjoy your coffee.

Once it is done, go ahead and run your application!
